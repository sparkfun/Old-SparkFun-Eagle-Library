SparkFun Electronics' preferred foot prints for Eagle 5.11 and earlier. We've spent an enormous amount of time creating and checking these footprints and parts. If you enjoy using this library, please buy one of our products at http://www.sparkfun.com. Please also note that we guarantee that there are some messed up footprints in this library. We've tried to note which are proven and tested but by downloading this file, you acknowledge that you are using this file at your own risk. We cannot be held responsible for faulty PCBs. Always check your parts against a 1:1 printout.

For attribution, we ask that when you begin to sell your device using our footprint, you email us with a link to the product being sold. We want bragging rights that we helped (in a very small part) to create your 8th world wonder. We would like the opportunity to feature your device on our homepage.

This is the complete Spark Fun Electronics default foot prints for Eagle. We switched to Eagle back in 2006 and have been extremely impressed with its ease of use and flexibility. As with any new software, it's like learning a new language and takes time. Do it. Eagle is great.
